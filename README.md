5 minute recource pack to make minecraft arrows xayah feathers\
This was technically made for Kismet & J but they did not ask, I just imposed myself on them.

# If you are trying to use this pack
it is terrible. My art skills are rather horrible, but you can insert your own textures to make it
look not horrible, just remember that the bow texture is an animation made from 4 textures, and that
having them be the same or a similar thing is highly reccomended.\
Also please note that the wrong version lock applies at the moment - no idea how to fix this since I havent made resourcepacks since version 1.8, where this was'nt an issue.

# Installing the Pack
if youve done this before, it works like any old resource pack.\
- Go to your Minecraft Options
- Click on Resourcepacks
- Open the Resourcepack folder
- Drag the pack in
- if the pack doesnt show instantly, close and reopen the resource pack option tab
- apply the pack
- enjoy

# Modifying the pack
changing the textures for the pack is relatively simple, however theres a few rules if you want it to work & look correct.
- only directly replace files; minecraft relies on a file structure to grab textures, which means file location and name for the desired texture can not be changed
- use no half-transparent pixels, and use png base material with full transparency; Minecraft does not take out jpeg blacks when loading textures, so use real transparency, also half-transparent pixels hide the pixels behind them in the simulated 3d view of the side of an item, and will cause your item to look two dimensional.
- feel free to modify my stuff; This isnt strictly a rule, but I think its fun.
